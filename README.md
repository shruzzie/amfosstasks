MY VIEWS ON THE TASKS
_____________________
These tasks gave me a lot of knowledge and was also a clear indicator how efficient googling can actually yield results within a short span of time. At the beginning, I was pretty intimidated by looking at the tasks but as time passed, my skills and efficiency became better.
